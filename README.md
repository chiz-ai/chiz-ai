- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**
- 🎓 **Adaptive Cybersecurity Education**
- 📚 **Explainable AI (XAI)** in Education
- 📈 **Optimizing AI-Generated Learning Paths**

☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure & Architecture**
- ☁️ **AWS Cloud Solutions**
- 🚀 **Cloud Migration & Integration**
- 🔐 **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)**

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**
- **Programming:** Python, R
- **AI Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face
- **Reinforcement Learning:** OpenAI Gym, Stable-Baselines3, RLlib
- **DevOps & Cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS

📖 **Currently Exploring**
- Comparative studies between **AI-generated vs. human-created cybersecurity assessments**
- Development of **Synthetic Learner Environments** for RL experiments
- Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate effective cybersecurity assessments aligned with specific learning objectives
- Integration of **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques in adaptive learning paths
